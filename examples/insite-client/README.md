This frontend exposes a web interface to make purchases and checkout against a [examples/rest-3ds-server](../rest-3ds-server) backend, which should be running on port 8081.

## Usage

Dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```
